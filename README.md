# Distribution-Fitting

Project 1
This repository includes data and analysis for the 'tips' dataset. Most importantly, the data contains information about tip amounts for customers at a restaurant. It includes; Total bill, tip amount, sex, smoker (yes or no), day of the week , time of day (afternoon or evening) and size of the party. We can use these variable to find relationships in the data, such as bill vs. tip amount or differences in tip amount between smokers & non-smokers. At the end, we'll plot the distribution of tip amount and also overlay an ex-gaussian plot over the actual distribution. The code for producing the ex-gaussian curve is explained in depth by Dr. Thomas J. Faulkenberry of Tarleton State University: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lf7n_NU6vs&t=1586s
